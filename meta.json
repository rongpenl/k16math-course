The goal of this website is to develop a self-contained series of mathematics courses for kids (kindergarten) as well as undergraduate students (13-16th grades). ",
    "bio": "I believe education plays a core role in a society. This project reflects my experience as a tutor at School on Wheels. Education can't be completely free for obvious economic reasons, but everything on this website IS free as its creator said so.",
