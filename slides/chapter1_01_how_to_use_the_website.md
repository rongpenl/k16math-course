## How to use this website

Welcome! This is the first slide.

1. Click the forward and backward buttons on the **bottom right** to move between pages.
2. On the right side of the screen, you will find some notes about the current page or slides.
3. At current stage, the website doesn't have an account system so your record will be cached by your browser only. 
4. There is no *locking* or any other mechanism forbidding you to skip materials. You can even check the answer of the quiz directly. To summarize, I put my **trust** in you that you know how to make the best use of the materials.

I try my best to build the website to be self-contained. If you can't understand some materials or solve a quiz, there **must** be another materials on this website that can help you to continue your learning on this website rather than jumping around links on the internet. Searching for many students, especially kids, is very inefficient and distracting. I try to keep students engaged all the time by fine-tuning the structure and materials continuously.

Notes: This is the note section. Usually I will put some references, interesting links like YouTube videos or great visualizations in this side-column.

## How are the materials presented?

Materials are organized into chapters. Chapters have specific topics. For example, `Algebra 2` or `Pre-calculus` are two chapter names. 

In each chapter, there will be three kinds of sections: reading, quiz and coding. A reading section contains materials you normally see in textbook like words, pictures and equations. An equation looks like $$\frac{2}{3}*\frac{9}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$$

Reading section may also contain some code. Such code snippets will be useful for coding assignments in the coding sections.

```python
greetings = "Hello!"
print(greetings)
```
Quiz sections are usually pretty short, following reading sections immediately.

If you are a student rushing to learn, quit this chapter and start learning now!

## Why do I include coding materials?

The biggest difference between this website and many others is that I include a lot of coding materials. There are three reasons.
1. Both in the United States and China, coding has been an essential part of education no matter the field of study.
2. Coding is of great fun.
3. Many students still struggle to learn materials like `Algebra` and `Calculus`. Combining coding and traditional materials can boost the learning of both.

Depending on the specific topics, some topics may only contain a small portion of coding while others may contain much more.

Note: **What I can't create, I do not understand** Richard Feynman.
